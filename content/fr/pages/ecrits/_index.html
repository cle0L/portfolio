      The path of our demise.

        <p>On the perilous path of my demise, the moody hoof of my loyal horse couldn't stop from hitting the ground, with the grace of an elephant walking on pieces of glasses. Nothing that could bother me, not with all the tics that made me swear or twitch every five seconds. I’d be nothing but a hypocrite from making fun of this poor beast, because at the end of the day, we are good companions, maybe the best match of this miserable history. He’s carrying my slender body from east to west, without complaining, and I'm genuinely grateful for it. But I’d be lying if I told you that he was my only companion during this journey. Not when from the corner of my eyes, I could see the reflection of someone who has always been by my side, way before Hervey the Horse. Where there should be a watch on my wrist, there was a fine piece of a mirror. It was as round as a luxury plate from our diner room, but little enough to be the size of a newborn mouse. That was enough for me to look at the reflection I was used to. Not mine, cause weirdly enough, <i>I’d never really had one</i>, <i>but someone else’s, someone that I’d never really met.</i> </p><p>Only shiny hair welcomed me this time, when I was seeking for her azure eyes, almost looking for her approbation. I was so easily distracted by the possibility of her presence, when I was given more time than I could wish for, to look at her. Yet, I was hoping for one last look. Sorry Vélesya, I can’t let myself be distracted by you. You see, I’ve got a head <b>to cut off.</b> </p><p>The more the hoof of my horse crushed this stinky land, the more my eyes darkened. The anger I left for this beautiful reflection came back right away as I remembered the reason behind this journey. That made me impatient. All the grieving and the need for revenge crashed in my belly, making me almost dizzy from the waiting. My head was full of thoughts, full of desire that I couldn’t express without tripping on the words. So full that I couldn't even hear myself. I was deaf, crazy even. They took my sister away from me. I’ll take their heir away from them. Justice will be done the moment I’ll feel his hair under my fingers. Blessed by the insolence of my royal bloodline, I’ve traveled the whole empire, only so I could slaughter the prince of Kérès. My sister for this cockroach. Filth – </p><p>- Sufficient reptile! Piece of garbage! <i>I spat it out in a tic I couldn't retain. </i></p><p>I blinked an outrageous amount of time, hiding the storm growing in my eyes. Hervey; my dear Hervey; must have felt it, because all of the sudden, he began to walk faster, and I knew we were close. So close that my senses could feel his presence, could feel every fiber of his insignificant being. His silhouette was growwing bigger every second. Deeply, I wished he was naive enough to freely think about something he liked. Something pleasant. I hoped in his last moment, he’d be full of innocence, as his eyes will stare at me, the actor of his demise. Silently, I came down the muddy land. I crossed through wild bushes, even fought a little, still silently. And then I jumped in front of him, like a wild animal, ready to cut his head off without a word. </p><p><i>It didn’t go as planned. </i></p><p>Remember the shiny hair that looked like pure sunlight ? I never thought I’d look at them if not through a reflection. Yet, here she was, and I was certainly not dreaming this time. Stunning, taller than I expected, standing there, almost surprised to see me. How strange her name felt in my mouth now that I had the chance to pronounce it. I wish I knew how to talk without stuttering. I should have signed it, as I always do. and not let her know about my stutter, all my tics and what makes me the mad prince of the crown. I didn’t care about what people thought, not anymore. But I cared about what she might think of me. Yet . . .</p><p> - V-V-Vélesya? <i>I struggle to pronounce, the ‘V’ blocked between the bite of my lips. </i></p><p>Now, I was just ashamed of my pronunciation, wishing to disappear, completely forgetting the murder I was about to commit. A crime? What crime? I would never even bother a fly. Obviously, I was lying to myself, as I was ready to lie to her. Even if she knew me probably more than I never knew my own self, I couldn’t put her on this journey of vengeance. She would probably understand, but still. That was my choice, my anger, my problem. <i>Not hers.</i> </p><p>After a couple of minutes, you could hear a pin drop. Not sure that she had recognized me; or that I might have fantasized our whole relationship and connection through reflection, how crazy this could be right; I signed her name with my hand, as it was our only way to communicate since then. My only way to communicate actually. You’re not able to stutter or talk for that matter when you’re a prince. If your pronunciation is not perfect, you should just, you know, not talk at all. She seems to finally get back from where she was, looking right at me, as confused as she was the moment I jumped in front of her. I would die to know what she was thinking, what I was supposed to do, so I could make the best impression. I knew her as far as I could remember, yet, I was trembling from apprehension. It wasn’t supposed to happen like that. </p><p>- Al’? <i>She finally said with a soft voice, not the one I’ve imagined, but still sounded pretty good</i>; What are you doing so far from your land? What is- Are you okay? </p><p>She didn’t know what to say, and what was she supposed to say actually? All of this was strange. I was just grateful that she cared about me. She just could tell me “hi” and I’ll still be content with it. Content enough to miss the fact that she was almost afraid that I could find what she was hiding. If my heart was pounding at some point, it completely stopped when I began to sign an answer, and he came out of the blue. Him. She looked at me, looking for a reaction, as I felt my anger flew through my veins. I knew that I would not hesitate for a second to cut his head off, already moving from my place using some dark magic of mine before she could stop me. She betrayed me after all, my very everything was with my greatest enemy, and always was actually. I could see how this story would end, I couldn't blame her for it, as much as I was angry at her right now. I’ll wait for her dagger to dive into my heart ; as I could never get rid of her ; and let some unspoken words get out of my dying mouth, just for her to know that my death from her hand had given a meaning to my life. I could have talked to her, to them. Instead, I chose the path of <i>my demise.</i><br></p>
